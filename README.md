# OPL_C-Project_ShowcasingLanguge
This paired project is assigned alongside Jesse Hines to develop a presentation on C# as a language as well as solving 2 of 3, truing, maze game, or picking a problem to solve.

# Networking C# Demo
by James Logan Milliron
Solving *Shine* with a basic client/server chat implementation.

Two Console Apps that will use my own "protocol" from networking one as client, one as server and use it to talk back and forth.
Prof. O. would like to see the server be capable of using my past GUIs with the server.
Prof. O. also stresses justify using any libraries that I need to use.

in H3 Functions). You do not have to include the parser—that's extra credit, as are further
refinements and extensions up to and beyond what we've worked through in class, as long
as they're clearly documented. Remember to include all of the following features:
If we've implemented Tru in your language, implement Rope instead.

2. (A)maze: Create a simple text-based adventure game based on the structure described
below. Interesting extensions (for extra credit) could include various power-ups, items used
to unlock other rooms or items later, boss battles, a GUI, backwards movement, etc.

3. *Shine*: Select an interesting problem, then design and implement a solution that
showcases your language. The problem doesn't have to be something that hasn't already
been solved, but the solution must be yours, not just a copy of an existing tutorial. It also
doesn't have to be large—a few dozen lin
